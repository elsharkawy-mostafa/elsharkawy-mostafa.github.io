    <p><strong>Ph.D. Candidate</strong> â€“ Department of Political Science, University of Michigan</p>

    <p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on the politics of religion, identity, and violence predominantly in the Middle East and Muslim-majority countries.</p>
    <p>My dissertation project combines text analysis, survey data, and qualitative interviews to investigate the political behaviour of religious authorities during periods of political crisis and contention. I am grateful to the Global Islamic Studies Center, the Rackham Graduate School, and the APSA-MENA for support.</p>
    <p>Prior to arriving at Michigan, I graduated from the University of Toronto with a B.A. in International Relations and Public Policy. I have also worked as a researcher at the Canadian Network for Research on Terrorism, Security and Society and as a policy assistant at the House of Commons.</p>
