Welcome! I'm a **Ph.D. candidate in Political Science** at the University of Michigan.  
My research focuses on the politics of religion, identity, and violence, predominantly in the Middle East and Muslim-majority countries. My dissertation project combines text analysis, survey data and qualitative interviews to investigate the political behaviour of religious authorities during periods of political crisis and contention. I am grateful to the Global Islamic Studies Center, the Rackham Graduate School, and the American Political Science Association (APSA-MENA) for supporting my research.

Prior to arriving at Michigan, I graduated from the University of Toronto with a B.A. in International Relations and Public Policy. Previously, I worked as a researcher at the Canadian Network for Research on Terrorism, Security and Society focusing on violent extremism in Canada. I also worked at the Canadian House of Commons as a policy assistant.
